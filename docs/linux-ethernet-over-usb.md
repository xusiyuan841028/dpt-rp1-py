# Accessing the DPT-RP1 over USB in Linux

To use the DPT-RP1 through the USB cable, you need to perform two steps:

  1. Switch the USB mode for DPT-RP1 to Ethernet-over-USB.
  2. Determine the IPv6 link-local address for `digitalpaper.local` using mDNS.

## Switching the USB mode the Ethernet-over-USB.

When the DPT-RP1 is plugged into a USB port, it appears as a USB CDC ACM device (i.e. a serial port), usually at `/dev/ttyACM0`.

By sending a sequence of bytes to this serial port, the DPT-RP1 mode can be switched to Ethernet-over-USB.

The DPT-RP1 supports two protocols for Ethernet-over-USB : remote NDIS (RNDIS) for Windows machines, and USB CDC/ECM for Macs. Linux supports both these modes. 

You only need to enable one of these modes.

### Activating RNDIS mode

To activate RNDIS mode, send the following Python byte sequence to `/dev/ttyACM0` using [pyserial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/) for example.

    b"\x01\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x04"

Check the output of `dmesg` to verify this worked:
    
    rndis_host 2-1:1.0 usb0: register 'rndis_host' at usb-0000:00:14.0-1, RNDIS device, xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
    
where `xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx` is the Ethernet address for the DPT-RP1.

### Activating CDC/ECM mode

To activate CDC/ECM mode, send the following alternative Python byte sequence:

    b"\x01\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x01\x01\x04"

The `dmesg` command will show:

    cdc_ether 2-1:1.0 usb0: register 'cdc_ether' at usb-0000:00:14.0-1, CDC Ethernet Device, xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

## De-activate DHCP on the new Ethernet device

If you're using DHCP to obtain addresses, you should disable it for the DPT-RP1, since the DPT-RP1 does not run a DHCP server. 

For example, if you're using Network Manager, change the IPv4 settings on the DPT-RP1 Ethernet device to 'Link-Local Only' instead of 'Automatic'. This will assign your end of the Ethernet link an IPv4 link-local address in the 169.254.0.0/16 range. 

When using Network Manager, also make sure that in the 'Ethernet' tab, 'device' is set to the interface name, not the MAC address. This will help Network Manager to restore the settings when connecting next time.

## Determining the address for DPT-RP1

The DPT-RP1 uses an IPv6 link-local address when in Ethernet-over-USB. You can determine this address by using an mDNS resolver such as `avahi`.

    $ avahi-resolve -n digitalpaper.local
    digitalpaper.local	fe80::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx

Although this returns the IPv6 link-local address, at least on my system, this address is incomplete. IPv6 link-local addresses need a scope identifier which identifies the network interface (i.e. link). On my system, the DPT-RP1 Ethernet device appears as `usb0` (from the output of `ifconfig`), and therefore the full address is:

    fe80::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx%usb0

The full URI for the DPT-RP1 would be:

    https://[fe80::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx%usb0]:8443/...

This syntax is accepted by urllib3 v1.22 and above.
